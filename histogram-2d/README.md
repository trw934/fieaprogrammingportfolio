This is a project that I made for my Embedded Systems capstone course. It takes in a data set of "pixels"
and analyzes a subsection of those pixels called a "tile". It then builds a histogram of the pixels in the 
tile and writes the output to out.txt. The src directory contains the cpp and header files, and the test
directory contains drivers and test input.
