Portfolio of programming work for submission to Interactive Entertainment MS at FIEA  
My name is Thomas Wilson and I am a Computer Engineering major at University of Maryland College Park. This portfolio contains work that is a reflection of the skills
and experiences I gained throughout my time at University of Maryland College Park. I had planned on including work from my embedded software internship at Northrop Grumman
Innovation Systems, but was unable to do so because of security factors. I can say that it involved writing C and C++ code to ensure that flight software code could 
function across multiple operating systems and performing memory usage analyses. Ultimately, this is to demonstrate my programming knowledge to the Florida
Interactive Entertainment Academy.
