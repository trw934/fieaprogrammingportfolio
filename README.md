Portfolio of programming work for submission to Interactive Entertainment MS at FIEA  

My name is Thomas Wilson and I am a Computer Engineering major at University of Maryland College Park. This portfolio contains work that is a reflection of the skills
and experiences I gained throughout my time at University of Maryland College Park.  

The code samples I want to highlight are Movement.cs and Stars.c from my Game Programming course, ReverseEngineering.c from my Reverse Engineering and Hardware Security course, and a 2d Histogram project from my Embedded Systems capstone course. These code samples highlight some of my best work from University of Maryland.  

I had planned on including work from my embedded software internship at Northrop Grumman Space Systems, but was unable to do so because of security factors. I can say that it involved writing C++ and C code to ensure that flight software code could function across multiple operating systems. I also wrote code that performed memory analyses used by spaceflight software.  

In addition to code samples, I have included my resume for graduate school as well as the questions and answers to the written interview.  
  
Thank you for your time in considering this portfolio!
